Can you help me to create an interface as this one on the image that appears when the player turns their hand (any of them) to the top?
This interface must contain:
1 - Space for 3 cards (the max, but can be 0 as well)
2 - A clickable via VR button write "TRUCO"
3 - A gear icon to access the configuration (for now must trigger a print message as this screen doesn't exist)
4 - A three lines icon (or house icon, what you think represents the Menu better in games) to access the Menu (for now must trigger a print message as this screen doesn't exist)

(I already have the components as you can see, but they are appaering huddled together and every time, even without turning the palm up)

I also would like to fix the player initial height position when playing in VR, it's starting very high.
