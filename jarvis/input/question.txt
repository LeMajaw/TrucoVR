Can you help me to prepare a prompt to send to Manus AI in a way it be able to conclude my game?
This is the current situation of it and I need to have it working completely in my Meta Quest 3.
I need that the buttons of the PalmMenu be working properly.
That the truco, six, nine and twelve calls through the palm menu and 3D visual notifications in game be working.
That the entire game work within the Truco Paulista Rules.
I want a main menu before the game (that will be the one acessible from the menu button) with options to play online with
other 3 players, allowing create room, join room, add bots and select their difficulty level.
In the menu must have a button to play against bots, them an option to choose between the different difficulties levels
(easy, normal, hard and expert). In the configurations (the option in the menu and in the PalmMenu too) the user must be able to
select the volume of the sound effects as cards flipping and the volume of the other players voice (only for palmMenu config
button and only when in an online match).
I want a score with the round values and the turn values, like in the image I'm providing to you.
When the game ends, if it's against bots I want options to rematch and to select new difficult level, and one to return main menu.
When online I want an option to rematch and one to ajust bot levels (if there's any bot playing) and one to return to main menu.
The player must be able to change it's cards positions inside it's palmMenu and cards facing down can be playes following the
rules. The same for the Mao de 11 and for the 11 x 11, where nobody can sees it's own cards or the partner cards or any cards
until playing them.
