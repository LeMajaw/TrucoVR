The player is sat at the chair1 as it should be, but for some reason, the direction of it depends the direction of my real body at the real world.
Can we set the player fixed at the chair1 1 and facing the table always?
And can we make the meta button centralize back the player to the center of the chair1 and facing the table too?
(At this moment the meta button shows its animation but does anything)
